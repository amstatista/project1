title: About
---

 I'm a 20 year old university junior with an interest in analytics, business strategy and machine learning and their dynamic intersection. I enjoy answering questions using data and creating visualizations to break down key aspects of whatever it is that interests me (mainly football/soccer) to derive actionable insights. On occasion I will also post content from books and articles I read and movies that I watch.
